## JavaScript

## ****WHAT IS  JAVASCRIPT?****

JavaScript is a popular programming language used primarily for developing web applications and dynamic user interfaces. It is a high-level, interpreted language that is known for its versatility and ease of use. JavaScript is used to add interactive features to websites, such as pop-ups, animations, and interactive forms. It is also commonly used for creating browser-based games and mobile applications.

One of the key advantages of JavaScript is its ability to be used on both the CLIENT-SIDE and SERVER-SIDE of web development. On the CLIENT-SIDE, it creates dynamic user interfaces and interacts with a web page's Document Object Model (DOM). The SERVER-SIDE can be used with Node.js to create scalable and efficient web applications.

JavaScript has a vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools that make it easier to develop complex web applications. Some of the most popular frameworks include React, Angular, and Vue.js. These frameworks provide developers with pre-built components and tools that can speed up the development process.

Overall, JavaScript is a powerful and widely-used programming language that is essential for web development. Whether you are developing a simple website or a complex web application, JavaScript is a key tool that can help you create dynamic and interactive user experiences.

## JAVASCRIPT RELEASES…

**1995: 1.** 👉 Brendan Eich creates the very first version of JavaScript in just 10 days. It was called Mocha, but already had many fundamental features of modern JavaScript!

**1996: 2.** 👉 Mocha changes to LiveScript and then to JavaScript, in order to attract Java developers. However, JavaScript has almost nothing to do with Java ☝. Microsoft launches IE, copying JavaScript from Netscape and calling it JScript;

**1997: 3.** 👉 With a need to standardize the language, ECMA releases ECMAScript 1 (ES1), the first official standard for JavaScript (ECMAScript is the standard, and JavaScript is the language in practice);

**2009: 4.** 👉 ES5 (ECMAScript 5) is released with lots of great new features;

**2015: 5**. 👉 ES6/ES2015 (ECMAScript 2015) was released: the biggest update to the language ever! ECMAScript changes to an annual release cycle in order to ship less features per update 🙏

**2016: 6.** 👉 Release of ES2016 / ES2017 / ES2018 / ES2019 / ES2020 / ES2021 / ... / ES2089 😅
